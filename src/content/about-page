<h2 class="hili biggie">Interactive // Sound</h2>

<h3 class="topper">// Best Foot Forward</h3>

<p>Cruzat.Media was founded in 2018 to serve interactive and audio needs in Portland, OR and beyond.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Devotion</h3>

<p>We focus on interactive and audio as our resources are already geared in that direction. We bring 20 years\' experience to each discipline and are comfortable in our roles as specialists. We would prefer to network and collaborate with other devotees if additional services are required, for example photography or video production. We are fortunate to be based in a city rich with practitioners; if we are not the direct solution we are always the pathway to the solution.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Different Worlds, Modern Worlds</h3>

<p>Interactive is its own beast, and can mean many different things. There is no ready-built solution that will always work, our experience has shown is the ideal is fewer reusable templates, more fluency in different methods and remaining malleable in their application. No two projects are ever the same and should never be approached as such, we generally advocate for each build to start from scratch.</p>

<p>Sound is unique to the senses, you can occupy a space in your listener\'s mind where you are able to utilize their visual imagination without requiring a Hollywood budget or VFX crew. Despite the advent of visual innovations like 4KHD and 3D/VR, audio based content like podcasts, audiobooks and good ole fashioned music continue to surge in popularity. People still listen.</p>

<div class="centro">

<h3 class="topper">// Worlds Within</h3>

<p>What Interactive and Sound share in our modern world is proximity and intimacy. There are massive public events that are shared experiences, a festival or a convention, but more often than not it\'s small and personal. Someone is on their phone or on their laptop, looking at your website, listening to your podcast. We want to help you in putting your best foot forward in either format.</p>

<p>If that experience is effective, the connection is made. You look good, you sound good. To have your brand associated with quality is worth its weight in Californium.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Building Bridges Between Worlds</h3>

<p>The projects we are most intrigued by are those that seek to find connections between these two worlds. For example, this very website has an audio component for those who prefer to listen to their content, each copy-centric page has an accessibility compliant mechanism for playing a reading of that copy. So rather than letting a screen reader make your presentation sound robotic (bordering on ridiculous), you can present your own words, in your own voice.</p>

<h2 class="hili biggie">Hi, my name is Dan Cruzat and I\'m a big ol nerd.</h2>

<img class="bigshot f-right" src="'+mE+'" alt="Dan Cruzat">

<h3 class="topper">// From the top</h3>

<p>I arrived in Portland in October of 2006, having spent the previous six years grinding in the flourishing indie hip hop scene in Chicago of that era -- Kanye blew up and we felt invincible. Having worked as a recording engineer, music producer, web designer and Flash developer in the midwest, I streamlined my efforts on arriving in the Pacific Northwest, focusing professionally on interactive development.</p>

<p>[...I did continue to make music during this time, but just for fun. I compiled all the best bits <a href="http://listento.thecruzat.com/decade" title="Check out D/EC/AD/E" target="_blank">here...]</a></p>

<p>In the time since, I have been fortunate to work with some amazing talent in the City of Roses, finding my place in its vibrant digital creative community. My journey has taken me on many turns with tech (more below), but my current specializations include WordPress customization and front end development in Vue.js.</p>

<div class="centro">

<h3 class="topper">// Ellsworth + Cruzat</h3>

<p>In 2010, I was lucky enough to cross paths with Christine Ellsworth, a skilled designer and world class snarkburglar. We became fast friends and started talking about collaboration, one project lead to two lead to more. Suddenly we had a handful of indie clients in Portland.</p>

<img src="'+eencee+'" alt="E+C / Ellsworth + Cruzat" class="f-left bigshot">

<p>In 2012, while working on UX for a rework of the Rose City Rollers website, we decided to create a shared banner for our projects, and <a href="http://eencee.me" target="_blank">E+C (Ellsworth + Cruzat)</a> popped into the world. Not a legal partnership or company, but a continuing collaborative relationship where we play to each others\' strong suits while retaining our own autonomy as contractors.</p>

<p>Christine Ellsworth has been my go-to for visual creative ever since.</p>

<p>Thank you Tini.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Rough Starts</h3>

<p>In my time in code I have worked with many languages, but the mainstays over the years have been HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In the very beginning, complicated OOP and DOM manipulation were well beyond me, JavaScript beyond simple layout effects felt like magic.</p>

<p>By 2005, Flash had been a central focus for many years, I had worked on projects ranging from the small, mp3 players and smart video banners, to the very not small, product catalogs and massive guided clickthroughs walkthroughs, but all of that had been primarily timeline based.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Honing Edges</h3>

<p>Team based development exposed me to more advanced ideas and methods, as well as teaching me the value of seeking assistance for a given problem or bug. I had never been able to crack JavaScript beyond basic effects, ActionScript, AS2 and AS3 gave me my proper education in OOP.</p>

<p>After smartphones killed Flash, I went back to basics with HTML and CSS. At the time JQuery was becoming the new rage and I was able to parlay what I had learned about OOP over from AS2/AS3. JQuery, in turn, made JavaScript more accessible to my brain, so it\'s hard to say that any of the skills I gained in Flash dev have been lost.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Finding Answers</h3>

<p>Not long after that, a platform that had been known primarily for blogging started to make great strides towards full site development, suddenly WordPress was becoming a real contender for an out-of-the-box CMS that keeps clients (and developers) happy. I eased into WordPress theme development around 2010, two years later I was helping a number of local agencies figure out how their content requirements could translate into clean intuitive dashboards.</p>

<p>In 2015, I joined a team of brilliant developers in working on a longer term project building an application for a leading ISP, this was my crash course in Angular and a great refresher in working on a large team. No need to sweat the entire application, we all had one little piece to chew on at a time. And around halfway through 2016, I transitioned into a QA / Team Support role, it was becoming obvious that there were other directions in FED that needed exploration.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// Next Steps</h3>

<p>After the team wrapped production on our super-app (Giggy Forever), I continued my education in JavaScript-based systems. The <a href="http://listento.thecruzat.com/decade" target="_blank">D/EC/AD/E</a> website was built in Angular2, and even at the time it was clear that React.js and Vue.js were both worthy of serious consideration.</p>

<p>It was around this time that I decided to start Cruzat.Media, a way of bringing web development tasks under the same umbrella as my first love, audio recording, but also continuing to offer support services for those in need of bug fixes, QA, or a general wrangler on a team.</p>

<h3 class="topper">// There\'s more to life</h3>

<p>Familia es todo. I work best with people who understand this.</p>

<p>Besides all things work related, the House of Cruzat sits on a happy street in SE Portland. Periodically there\'s some sloppy acoustic guitar twanging in the back yard. Our roses are coming in lovely this year.</p>

<p>I am lucky and grateful that I can provide for my family working in fields where I have been able to define my own path.</p>
